# Kafka-ATM-Transaction-Processing-with-Message-Keys-and-Offsets
This project demonstrates how Apache Kafka can be used to process and manage ATM transactions efficiently. It shows how to maintain the order of messages in ATM transactions, leveraging Kafka's features like message keys, consumer offsets, and partitions. This setup ensures that messages from the same ATM are processed in sequence.
